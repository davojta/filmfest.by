---------------

The third annual international independent short film festival “Cinema Perpetuum Mobile” is a non-profit cultural event. The Organizing committee was formed by the members of kinaklub.org community, which gathers enthusiasts and film-fans devoted to the values of continual and free cinema art.

### Festival’s purposes

* To promote independent film-making. Short film is a low-budget, and thus affordable democratic method of art expression. This allows to cover any actual and burning issue while staying laconic.
* To support cultural diversity in cinema and discovering of new forms and methods in film art. 
* To assist in establishing and consolidating of communication between film-makers and film societies. 

As reflected in its name, the idea of the festival is to touch upon eternal, perpetual subjects. The measure of how perpetual the subject is, is determined by it’s unquestionable importance and humanistic value. But also, with issues of this kind, a fresh and reasonable view is a needed. That is why, both traditional and innovative approaches in interpretation of perpetual subjects are appreciated, as well as the whole spectrum of different cinematic forms - from silent to experimental.

Any interested person, who agrees with principles and ideas presented in the regulations, can become a participant of the festival, no matter what his/her skin color, height, weight, place of residence or age is. The requirement for becoming a participant is a filled-in participant’s entry form and a completed film. 

Festival screenings and selection of winners will take place simultaneously in Minsk and other locations on our planet, in April 2014. They gather more and more people who enjoy watching good films and are not indifferent to the problems of mankind.

Participance in the festival is free of any charges.


### Film selection and screenings

Two factors determine film selection procedure: marks given to the film by audience at pre-screenings (volunteer film-fans who are not indifferent to the principles of kinaklub.org society) and marks given by the organizing committee members.

At pre-screenings, all films are going to be rated on scale from 1 to 10. The resulting mark will be the sum of both committees’s and volunteer viewers’ marks.  

The Organizing committee includes films with the highest average marks from volunteer viewers in the contest program, but leaves itself the right to exclude high-rated films, if they do not correspond with festival’s purposes and ideas, as well as include underrated films with high quality and humanistic value.  


￼Apart from the contest screenings, the festival program also includes out-of-competition thematic screenings (on ecological, urbanistic, gender issues, and also special screenings for the younger audience). The program of out-of-competition screenings is prepared by the members of the organizing committee. 

The festival has a network structure, with screenings going simultaneously not only in different cities of Belarus, but also all around the planet Earth. For screenings in different festival-friendly film societies there will be prepared a special program, which consists of both contest and out-of-competition films with a total runtime of 1 hour 30 minutes.
